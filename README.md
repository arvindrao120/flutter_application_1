[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) [![Flutter Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter-%3E%3D3.x.x-blue)](https://flutter.dev/) [![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Android%20%7C%20iOS%20%7C%20Web%20%7C%20Desktop-lightgrey)](https://flutter.dev/) This is my first Flutter project, exploring the basics of app development with Flutter. It demonstrates setting up a basic application structure.

## ✨ Features

* **AppBar Title:** Displays a customizable title in the application's AppBar.
* **Drawer Implementation:** Includes a basic side navigation Drawer accessible via an icon in the AppBar.
* Basic Scaffold Layout: Utilizes the `Scaffold` widget for standard Material Design layout.
* State Management using [Provider/Bloc/Riverpod/GetX/Stateless/Stateful Widgets] - *mention your approach, even if basic StatefulWidget/StatelessWidget*
* ... (Add any other features you implement)

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* **Flutter SDK:** Make sure you have the Flutter SDK installed. Find instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
    * *Recommended Flutter Version:* [Specify the version, e.g., 3.19.0 or >=3.16.0]
* **IDE:** Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code with Flutter plugins.
* **[Any other dependencies]:** e.g., specific package managers.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]

    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **[Optional: Environment Setup]**
    * If needed, explain how to set up environment variables (e.g., API keys). Add `.env` to `.gitignore`.

4.  **[Optional: Platform-Specific Setup]**
    * Mention if any specific setup like Firebase config files (`google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`) is needed.

### Running the App

1.  **Ensure a device/emulator is running.**
    * List devices: `flutter devices`

2.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

    * **[Optional: Flavors/Build Variants]** Explain if you use different build flavors.

## 🔧 Building for Production (Examples)

* **Desktop:** `flutter build [macos | windows | linux]`

## 🧪 Running Tests (If Applicable)

* **Unit & Widget Tests:**
    ```bash
    flutter test
    ```
    (Tests are usually in the `test/` directory).

## 🏗️ Project Structure (Optional)
